A Cursor lets you read from and
write to the database.
 You create a cursor by calling the
SQLiteDatabase query()
method. Behind the scenes, this builds
a SQL SELECT statement.
 The getWritableDatabase()
method returns a
SQLiteDatabase object that
allows you to read from and write to
the database.
 The getReadableDatabase()
returns a SQLiteDatabase
object. This gives you read-only
access to the database. It may also
allow you to read from and write to the
database, but this isn’t guaranteed.
 Navigate through a cursor using the
moveTo*() methods.
 Get values from a cursor using the
get*() methods.
 Close cursors and database
connections after you’ve finished with
them.
 A CursorAdapter is an
adapter that works with cursors.
Use SimpleCursorAdapter
to populate a ListView with the
values returned by a cursor.
 Design your app so that you put useful
content in your top-level activity.
 The CursorAdapter
changeCursor() method
replaces the cursor currently used by
a cursor adapter to a new cursor that
you provide. It then closes the old
cursor.
 Run your database code in
a background thread using
AsyncTask.
